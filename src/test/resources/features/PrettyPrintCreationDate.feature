Feature: Each entry should have creation date

    Scenario: Pretty print effective date for last 24 hours
        Given current date and time is '2010-01-12 12:00' 
        When I enter following entry details
            | creationDate     |
            | <creationDate>   |
        And I try to submit my skill
        Then I should see entry with creation date displayed as '<display>'

        Examples:
            | creationDate      | display           |
            | 2012-01-12 12:00  | now               |
            | 2012-01-12 11:59  | 1 minute ago      |
